            <h2>Buran – The Soviet Shuttle</h2>
            <p>In 1988 the USSR launched Buran, an unmanned space shuttle that completed two orbits and landed automatically — a feat no other shuttle has matched to this day.</p>

            <p>Mir orbited Earth for 15 years (1986–2001) and was the first modular space station. Cosmonauts set endurance records aboard it, including Valeri Polyakov's 437 consecutive days in space.</p>

            <p>Between 1970 and 1985 the Soviet Venera probes were the first spacecraft to land on another planet. Venera 13 survived Venus's crushing 90-atmosphere pressure long enough to send back colour photos.</p>

            <p>The Soviet N1 was the largest rocket ever attempted at the time — 105 m tall with 30 engines in its first stage. All four test flights between 1969–1972 ended in failure, and the programme was secretly cancelled.</p>

            <p>On 18 March 1965, cosmonaut Alexei Leonov floated outside Voskhod 2 for 12 minutes — the first-ever spacewalk. His suit inflated so much he had to bleed air to squeeze back through the hatch.</p>
